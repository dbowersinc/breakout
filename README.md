### How to play the game: Game Specs

This is a version of breakout. The ball will constantly ricochet throughout the space as long as it does not pass below your paddle line.
Your objective is to not let the ball pass your paddle and break all the blocks.
You get points for every block that you break, and the point value increases with the level of block.
The ball speed will also increase the more blocks you break at the higher levels.
